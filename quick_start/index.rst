Quick Tutorial
******************

In this section, we're going to see how to build up a simple NStack module, deploy it to the cloud, and use it in a workflow by connecting it to a `source` and a `sink`. 

By the end of the tutorial, you will learn how to publish your code to NStack and connect it to event and data sources. Enjoy!

.. note:: To learn more about modules, sources, and sinks, read :ref:`Concepts<concepts>`

Make sure you have :doc:`installed NStack </installation>` and let's get going. These instructions are for the Linux and macOS versions of the NStack CLI, so adjust accordingly if you are on Windows.
